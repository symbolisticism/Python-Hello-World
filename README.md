# Overview

I am a BYU-I student majoring in Software Engineering. I am interested in databases and machine learning. I would like to be a part of a project that makes a lasting impact on the world. With how much data there is available to use, the possibilities are endless.

This repository contains a simple Hello World program written in Python.

I wanted to do this program in Python because I don't know Python and I want to learn it. It will be the start of many more.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write this program. I have a Python extension that helps with syntax. I also had to do some research on how to write a Hello World program in Python.

I used Python for this program.
